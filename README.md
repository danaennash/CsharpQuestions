#### 1. What is a namespace?

    Namespace is a way to organize and group code so that you can use the same function names and classes without causing confliction within a program. 
      
#### 2. What are value types? 

    Value types are data types that hold data within their own memory that is allocated.
      
#### 3. What are reference types?

    Reference types points to a memory location that holds the data needed/requested.
      
#### 4. What is an automatic property and how is it useful?

    Automatic property are like programming shortcuts. They are a way to write code in simpler context and allows private variables. It can be used in interfaces as well. 
      
#### 5. What is the purpose of using statement?
     
    Using statement is used for objects in C# that inherits IDisposable interface.
     
#### 6. What are dynamic type variables?

    A dynamic type variable resolves type at run time and in that way, avoids compile time error.
      
#### 7. What is the purpose of the is operator?

    The purpose of the is operator is to test to see if two variables point to the same object.  
      
#### 8. What are generics and how is using them useful?

    Generics are used to specify any declaration needed once and allows reuse without having to define the code again.  
      
#### 9. What is the scope of a public member of a class?

     The scope of a public member of a class allows a class to show its functions and variables to any public member can utilize it outside of the class. 
      
#### 10. Can you create a function that can accept a varying number of arguments?

     Yes.
      
#### 11. How do you sort an array?

     You can sort an array with many different methods depending on what you are attempting to do. You can sort them in ascending or descending order, using a comparing method, delegate them using a method of your choice and etc.
     
#### 12. What is a nullable type and what purpose does it serve?

     The nullable type is used to assign both normal values and null values. It can used to assigning Boolean variable to include true, false or null and are further good for when you want to assign values to values types that could or could not be null.  
      
#### 13. What is an enumeration?

     A data type that has a set of named values. 
      
#### 14. What is inheritance?

     Inheritance is the basing of an object or class on another object or class with similar attributes and implementations.
      
#### 15. Is multiple inheritance supported?

     Not in c# because it is too complex for too little benefit 

#### 16. What is the purpose of as operator?

     The as operator is used to convert compatible reference types to nullable types. 

#### 17. What is an object?

     An object is a block of memory within a class that has been allocated and configured.

#### 18. What is the difference between a struct and a class?

     Structs are value types and class are reference types. Structs cannot support inheritance and cannot have a null reference but classes can do both. 

#### 19. What is the difference between continue and break statements?

     Continue statements goes to the next iteration while break statements leave a loop.

#### 20. What is this and how is it used?

     This is used to refer the current instance of the class. Also used to seperate parameters/classes of the same name.

#### 21. What is try and catch and when are they used?

     Try and catch represent how to take care of exceptions due to errors during excution. Try is where the exception occurs and a catch block tries to catch the try block and handle the expectations.

#### 22. How is exception handling done?

     The try block points out the code where exceptions occur. The catch block is placed in the program where you want to handle the problem. The finally block is used to execute a given set of statements. 

#### 23. What is finally and what is its purpose?

     The finally statement is used to ensure all cleanup needed for an exception occurs immediately.

#### 24. List the differences between Array and ArrayList.

    Array | ArrayList
    ------ | ---------
    Stores specific types of elements & items | Stores any type of elements/items
    Can only store on data type | Can store all data type values
    Null not accepted | Null accepted
    
#### 25. What is an object?

     An object is a block of memory within a class that has been allocated and configured.

26. Define constructor.
27. When can var be used to declare a variable and how is the type for the variable determined?
28. What is an abstract class?
29. What is an interface?
30. What is a method?
31. What is a property?
32. What is an access specifier?
33. What access specifiers are supported and what do they mean?
34. What is a collection?
35. What is a Hash Table?
